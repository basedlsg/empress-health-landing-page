# Empress Health Design Bible

## Introduction

This document outlines the design principles and standards for the Empress Health website. It is a living document that will be updated as the project evolves.

## Core Principles

*   **Simplicity:** The design should be clean, uncluttered, and easy to navigate.
*   **Elegance:** The aesthetic should be modern, sophisticated, and visually appealing.
*   **Accessibility:** The website should be accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.

## Production Standards (Inspired by AKQA)

*   **Pixel Perfect:** All design elements should be implemented with precision and attention to detail.
*   **Consistent:** The design should be consistent across all pages and components.
*   **Performant:** The website should be fast and responsive.

## Design Recommendations

*   **Color Palette:** Adopt a calming and sophisticated color palette, using the existing brand colors as the foundation. I will use a color picker tool to extract the exact hex codes from the Empress Health logo and use them to create a new, more modern color palette.
*   **Typography:** Implement a modern, sans-serif font for body text and a clean, elegant serif font for headings. I will use a font pairing tool to find a modern, sans-serif font that complements the existing brand fonts.
*   **Layout:** Increase the use of white space to create a more open and breathable layout.
*   **Imagery:** Replace all stock photos with high-quality, professional photography that reflects the diversity of the Empress Health community. I will source all photos from a reputable stock photo website, such as Unsplash or Pexels.
*   **Interactivity:** Introduce subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.
*   **Personalization:** Allow users to customize their dashboard and choose a color theme.
*   **Luxurious Feel:** Use a combination of high-quality imagery, elegant typography, and a minimalist layout to create a luxurious feel that is consistent with the Louis Vuitton brand.
