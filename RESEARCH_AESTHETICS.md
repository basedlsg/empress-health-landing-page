# Research on Modern Web Design Aesthetics

## Key Principles

*   **Minimalism and White Space:** Modern design emphasizes simplicity and the use of ample white space to create a clean, uncluttered look. This improves readability and user experience.
*   **Typography:** Deliberate and custom typography is crucial for brand identity and communicating a message effectively.
*   **User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI):** A focus on intuitive navigation and user satisfaction is paramount.
*   **Visuals:** High-quality, real-life imagery and custom illustrations are preferred over stock photos. Parallax scrolling and other interactive elements can enhance user engagement.
*   **Color:** Grayscale aesthetics and bold, bright colors are both popular trends.

## Actionable Recommendations

*   **Increase White Space:** Add more padding and margins around elements to create a more breathable layout.
*   **Review Typography:** Select a modern, readable font that aligns with the Empress Health brand.
*   **Simplify Navigation:** Ensure the navigation is intuitive and easy to use.
*   **Upgrade Visuals:** Replace stock photos with high-quality, custom imagery.
*   **Consider Parallax Scrolling:** Implement parallax scrolling on the landing page to create a more dynamic and engaging experience.
